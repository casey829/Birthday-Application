        <h2 class="head1">On what day of the week were you born??</h1>
            <!--paragraph-->
            <p class="p1">Recently i learnt a very impressive trick: tell me the date you were born and i will almost
                immediately
                tell you what day of the week that was.</p>
            <p class="p2">Impressive right!!Know here comes the best part, i will give you an Akan name from the Ghanian
                culture
                according to your gender and the day you were born.</p>
            <p class="p3">The Akan are a meta-ethnicity predominantly speaking Central Tano languages and residing in
                the southern
                regions of the former Gold Coast region in what is today the nation of Ghana. Akans who historically
                migrated from Ghana also make up a plurality of the populace in the Ivory Coast. The Akan language (also
                known as Twi/Fante) is a group of dialects within the Central Tano branch of the Potou–Tano subfamily of
                the Niger–Congo family.</p>
